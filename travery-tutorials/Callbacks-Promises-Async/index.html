    <!--<p>Covering callbacks, promises, and async await. All are things deal with asyncronous
        JavaScript. It means that you don't want to wait until something is done before you move on and 
        continue your code.
        Async Progamming is relevant in JS because you will have to wait for responses from servers. You will 
        most likely will want to keep performing code. Callbacks were heavely used but Promises were implemented 
        when ES6 (JS2015) came out.
