# Build a Node.js API
This tutorial will use Node Express and MongoDb for REST routes and usage of a database. You will use CRUD operations and this will be helpful boilerplate for making a skeleton for using APIs.

freecodecamp uses MongoDB for this activity but I will be relying on Sequelize with MySQL for the database

## Activity Info
A note taking app that will use create, read, update, delete.
Since mLab isn't accepting any new Users, I had to use Sequelize in the meantime. Given the only knowledge I have of working with a database through Node. 

## To Do
Create a model for your Notes
Sync your model to MySQL
Set up the API routes to create and delete.
